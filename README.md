============

Lab 1: Learning to work with git.
----
In our first class of webtech 2 we started of to learn to work with Git. We learned to work with GIT for our future projects and to upload our task or help out classmates who have issues with some code.

**Here are a Few basic commands that you need to know in order start to work with GIT :**
    
    git clone ( This command clones your or someones elses repositories to location you are )
    git pull ( This command is used to "pull" the newest data )
    git add ( This command is to add your changes )
    git commit -m "message" ( This command commits your added things, don't forget the message! )
    git push ( this command pushes your work to github )
**Here are some commands when you fork a repository:**

    git fetch upstream
    git remote add upstream -reponame-
    git merge upstream/master

 
 **Here are a Few basic commands for your command prompt :**
 
    cd (change directory)
    ls ( to know what files are in the directory)


Lab 2: CSS animations.
----
Our second class was animating in CSS3 .
There are two types of ways to animate in css3 ( Transition and Transform ).
* Transition uses the engine of the browser which makes it slower on mobile devices.
* Transform uses the engine of the machine which makes it way faster than Transitions.

We also learned to animate in CSS3 with keyframes. The 2 exercises in "lab2" are a demo we had to create.
    
Lab 3: To Do-list. 
----
In this lab we created our own Framework in order to make our own To-Do-List, very interesting!
    
Lab 4: Weather app.
----
In deze lab hebben we leren werken met API's, voor dit te leren hebben we een kleine weer applicatie moeten bouwen.
Api's worden gebruikt om connectie te leggen met databases, meesten bedrijven stellen hun Databases open voor developpers zodat zei die gegevens kunnen gebruiken om applicaties te bouwen. 


Lab 5: IMD terAppke
----
Was a combination of bootstrap and Api's.

Lab 6: node.js
----

This was in my opinion a very tough course, had to aska lot of help from ziggy and I will use this eastern holidays to become better in node.js since it is very interesting.
