In our first class of webtech 2 we started of to learn to work with Git. We learned to work with GIT for our future projects and to upload our task or help out classmates who have issues with some code.

**Here are a Few basic commands that you need to know in order start to work with GIT :**
    
    git clone ( This command clones your or someones elses repositories to location you are )
    git pull ( This command is used to "pull" the newest data )
    git add ( This command is to add your changes )
    git commit -m "message" ( This command commits your added things, don't forget the message! )
    git push ( this command pushes your work to github )
**Here are some commands when you fork a repositorie:**

    git fetch upstream
    git remote add upstream -reponame-
    git merge upstream/master

 
 **Here are a Few basic commands for your command prompt :**
 
    cd (change directiory)
    ls ( to know what files are in the direcory)


Lab 2: CSS animations.
----
Our second class was animating in CSS3 .
There are two types of ways to animate in css3 ( Transition and Transform ).
* Transition uses the engine of the browser which makes it slower on mobile devices.
* Transform uses the engine of the machine which makes it way faster than Transitions.

We also learned to animate in CSS3 with keyframes. The 2 exercises in "lab2" are a demo we had to create.
